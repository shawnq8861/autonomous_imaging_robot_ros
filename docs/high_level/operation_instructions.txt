Startup: 

    When the robot powers on, the control system will automatically start up as the service
    "robobob_daemon". On power-up, the robot defaults to IDLE mode and won't attempt to execute
    any command unless prompted by the user.

Control:

    Type the command "manual" in the terminal just as one would type "ls" or "mkdir". Using the
    command prompt that appears, one can control the robot, or type "help" to learn how to use
    the tool in an easy and intuitive way.

Maintenence:

    If the control systsem needs to be restarted for some reason, one can use the following
    commands to stop and start the service respecftively:

        sudo systemctl stop robobob_daemon
        sudo systemctl start robobob_daemon
